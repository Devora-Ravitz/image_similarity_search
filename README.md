# Image Similarity and Clustering with ResNet50

1. Image Processing 🖼️
Resize: The images are resized to 224x224 pixels to meet the model's requirements.
Normalize: Pixel values are normalized to improve model performance and accuracy.
Ready for Model: The clothing images are now ready to be fed into the model for vector extraction.
2. Model Initialization 🧠
ResNet50 Pre-trained Weights: The ResNet50 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, is used to generate embeddings—vectors representing the essential features of the images, facilitating easy comparison.
3. Saving and Loading the Dataset 💾
Backup: It's always good to have a backup. The vectors are saved as a file and can be reloaded for further processing if needed.
4. Finding Similar Clothing 🔍
Cosine Distance: The vector of a given clothing image is compared with vectors in the dataset to find the most similar clothing items.
5. K-Nearest Neighbors 🧑‍🏫
KNN Algorithm: The K-nearest neighbors for a given clothing image are found using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm. This algorithm helps classify or predict the category or value of a new sample based on its similarity to previous samples.
6. Clustering 📊
KMeans Clustering: The clothing images in the dataset are clustered using KMeans, which groups the samples into several clusters, keeping the internal proximity within each cluster.
Visual Representation: The clusters are displayed visually, allowing you to see which images belong to the same cluster.

IMAGE SIMILARITY AND CLUSTERING WITH RESNET50
1. IMAGE PROCESSING 🖼️
RESIZE: THE IMAGES ARE RESIZED TO 224X224 PIXELS TO MEET THE MODEL'S REQUIREMENTS.
NORMALIZE: PIXEL VALUES ARE NORMALIZED TO IMPROVE MODEL PERFORMANCE AND ACCURACY.
READY FOR MODEL: THE CLOTHING IMAGES ARE NOW READY TO BE FED INTO THE MODEL FOR VECTOR EXTRACTION.
2. MODEL INITIALIZATION 🧠
RESNET50 PRE-TRAINED WEIGHTS: THE RESNET50 MODEL, PRE-TRAINED ON IMAGENET, IS USED TO GENERATE EMBEDDINGS—VECTORS REPRESENTING THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF THE IMAGES, FACILITATING EASY COMPARISON.
3. SAVING AND LOADING THE DATASET 💾
BACKUP: IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A BACKUP. THE VECTORS ARE SAVED AS A FILE AND CAN BE RELOADED FOR FURTHER PROCESSING IF NEEDED.
4. FINDING SIMILAR CLOTHING 🔍
COSINE DISTANCE: THE VECTOR OF A GIVEN CLOTHING IMAGE IS COMPARED WITH VECTORS IN THE DATASET TO FIND THE MOST SIMILAR CLOTHING ITEMS.
5. K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS 🧑‍🏫
KNN ALGORITHM: THE K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS FOR A GIVEN CLOTHING IMAGE ARE FOUND USING THE NEAREST NEIGHBORS ALGORITHM. THIS ALGORITHM HELPS CLASSIFY OR PREDICT THE CATEGORY OR VALUE OF A NEW SAMPLE BASED ON ITS SIMILARITY TO PREVIOUS SAMPLES.
6. CLUSTERING 📊
KMEANS CLUSTERING: THE CLOTHING IMAGES IN THE DATASET ARE CLUSTERED USING KMEANS, WHICH GROUPS THE SAMPLES INTO SEVERAL CLUSTERS, KEEPING THE INTERNAL PROXIMITY WITHIN EACH CLUSTER.
VISUAL REPRESENTATION: THE CLUSTERS ARE DISPLAYED VISUALLY, ALLOWING YOU TO SEE WHICH IMAGES BELONG TO THE SAME CLUSTER.
